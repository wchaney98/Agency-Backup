Scaling: Unfortunately most included particle systems use "-\\- over lifetime" parameters which are not accessible by script.
So it's impossible to scale them automatically.
However, manual scaling is very simple. Usually you just need to scale the velocity\force parameters proportionally to the size scale.
For example, you need to increase fire size 2 times. When you increase transform scale in the inspector, emitter size is increased automatically.
You need to increase start speed, startsize and velocit\force over lifetime 2 times.
If you have any problems with this please contact me, I'm always happy to help.

Good luck with your projects!
